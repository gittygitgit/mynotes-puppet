Why scope?
To limit the relevancy of stuff to well-defined contexts

What is scope-dependent?
- variables
- 

local scope
code inside a class def, defined type
var's and defaults declared in local are only available to that scope or its children

parent scope

node scope
code inside a node-definition
variables and resources declared at node scope are availabe everywhere but in top-level

top scope
code outside any node definition, class definition, type definition.



precedence
Any variable or default present in multiple scopes will have the one most local end up being used
code inside a class def, defined type
var's and defaults declared in local are only available to that scope or its children
