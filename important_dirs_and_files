configuration files
	puppet.conf — Puppet’s main config file. (Any node.)
	hiera.yaml — global configuration for the Hiera data lookup system. Note that environments and modules can have their own hiera.yaml files. (Master, or standalone nodes running Puppet apply.)


Main manifest
	Starting point of any puppet run

	puppet apply requires a manifest be passed manually
		doesn't automatically use an environment's manifest

	providing a directory as the main manifest causes all *.pp files to be combined and run as one, in alphabetical order

Module path
	dictates from where puppet loads modules

	Most code run by puppet comes from modules

	set based on the current node's environment

	by default, set to include active environment's modules directory

	<ACTIVE ENVIRONMENT'S MODULES DIRECTORY>:$codedir/modules:/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules

	/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache [chef:production] $ puppet config print modulepath --environment dev
