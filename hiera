puppet hiera
	Each env gets it's own hiera file



puppet lookup --module 


Keys

	format
	double-colon
		variables that start w/ double-colon are top-level
		factor facts are located in top-level

	automatic parameter lookup
		keys are declared in yaml as myclass::parm1

		referenced in class as
			class myclass($parm1 = "default") {

			}

	lookup function
		lookup (<name>, ...)


yaml
	hiera.yaml files
		top-level keys start with a colon



And puppet...
	puppet copies hiera config from the host to the guest when running

	

Concepts
What is lookup?
function that uses hiera to retrieve values stored under a given key


Layers
a tier in which keyed values can be stored
Hierarchical in that hiera searches certain layers before others

module layer
	hiera data stored within a module's data directory

	would contain a hiera.yaml file

	data would be stored under the data folder

environment
	a group of puppet agent nodes
	allows different usage of the same module in different environments

	how?
		create an environments folder under code/

		for each environment, create a folder under code/environments

		in each environment, create a modules and a manifests folder		

	contains a modules directory that becomes part of the environment's default module path

	may contain a hiera.yaml file 

	contains a manifests directory that will contain the env's default main manifest file



$environment
indicates the environment the current puppet run is running as




environment layer


Tiers
TODO

lookup_options
TODO

merge behavior
strategy for combining values in cases where a key exists in several data stores

key
A key under which a value can be stored


data source
A place where keyed values can be stored and retrieved by hiera


data provider
TODO

module data
data used in a module by means of resolution o a key / variable
module data is indicated by means of variables


params.pp pattern



Examples
puppet lookup --explain foo
puppet lookup --explain --environment dev foo

puppet lookup --explain --environment dev --node nasdaq.hdgemdev.com.yaml foo


Problems
	Undefined variable 'environment'

	Module data provider for module "helpdesk_legacy" not found
	Make sure you have a hiera.yaml file in the module
