puppet hiera
	Each env gets it's own hiera file

Concepts
What is lookup?
function that uses hiera to retrieve values stored under a given key


Layers
a tier in which keyed values can be stored
Hierarchical in that hiera searches certain layers before others

module layer
hiera data stored within a module's data directory

environment
	a group of puppet agent nodes
	allows different usage of the same module in different environments

	how?
		create an environments folder under code/

		for each environment, create a folder under code/environments

		in each environment, create a modules and a manifests folder		

	contains a modules directory that becomes part of the environment's default module path

	may contain a hiera.yaml file 

	contains a manifests directory that will contain the env's default main manifest file



$environment
indicates the environment the current puppet run is running as
